# Memory Game (a.k.a. learning modernish javascript)

When I started learning javascript, it was 'var', callbacks, jQuery, and qUnit.

Today I'm playing catch-up and using 'const/let', promises/async/await, vanilla js, and jest. Let's see how far I get before I pull my hair out.

## Try it out

[Play the game](https://kmilligan.github.io/memgam/test/)

## Basic usage

1. Include the memgam .js and .css files in your html.
2. Add a `div` with the `id='gameboard'` someplace in that html.
3. Create an instance of the game

  `const game = new memgam();`

4. Start the game

  `game.startNewGame();`

## How did we get here?
